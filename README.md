# Assignment 6: Huffman Coding <br>

## Short Description:<br>
This program makes use of Huffman Coding in order to both compress and decompress any data passed through it. It makes use of a priority queue in order to construct a Huffman Tree that can be traversed to reconstruct the original contents of the file.

## Build:<br>
A Makefile is provided and can be used to build the program. This can be accomplished within the directory where the program files are located by typing any of these commands: 'make', 'make all', 'make encode', 'make decode'. The command 'make format' will format all of the source code along with the header files. 

## Running:<br>
The format for running **encode**: (./encode **-i 'File to compress'** **'-o File to print compressed file'** **-v 'Print compression statistics'** **-h 'Help/Usage(OPTIONAL)'**) <br>
The format for running **decode**: (./decode **-i 'Input file to deccompress'** **-o 'Output file to print decompressed message'** **-v 'Print compression statistics'** **-h 'Help/Usage(OPTIONAL)'**) <br>

### 'Input Commands' <br>
**encode**<br>
-i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Input file to compress (default:stdin) <br>
-o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Output file to write compressed file (default:stdout) <br>
-v&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Display compression statistics <br>
-h&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Display program help and usage <br>
**decode**<br>
-i&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Input file to decompress (default: stdin) <br>
-o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Output file to write decompresssed file (default: stdout) <br>
-v&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Display compression statistics <br>
-h&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Display program help and usage <br>

## Cleaning: <br>
To remove all files that were generated by the compiler, type the command 'make cleanâ€™.
